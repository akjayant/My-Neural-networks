## Feedforward neural network (multilayered) still a bit rough and naive version - 

Designing a multilayered neural network taking no of layers and no of nodes in input using backpropogation on mean squared loss       minimisation using stohastic gradient descent. I have trained it on sin(x) just for sake of testing for now, so as to observe dC/dw (partial dericative of cost function wrt weights which is 'delta_cw' in my code).

## My Keras experiments

Making a neural network model using keras framework which uses tensorflow as backend and testing it on energy efficiency dataset-
