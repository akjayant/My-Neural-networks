### Perceptron (single hidden layer,single hidden node)

### Feedforward neural network (multilayered) *still a bit rough and naive version 

Designing a multilayered neural network taking no of layers and no of nodes in input using backpropogation on loss       minimisation using stohastic gradient descent. I have trained it on Energy Efficiency dataset -

 just for sake of testing for now.
 
 Activations options in code : relu,sigmoid ,Loss options in code : mean squared error ,cross entropy
 
 USED  - sigmoid activation,cross entropy loss
 
 Accuracy is pretty bad though!!
 

### My Keras experiments

Making a neural network model using keras framework which uses tensorflow as backend and testing it on energy efficiency dataset-
